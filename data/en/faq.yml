    - title : "What is the evaluation criteria for obtaining a certificate?"
      content : "For the certification, we expect consistent participation. Worksheets will be handed out in the tutorials and we will share feedback on your solutions, but this will not formally count towards your evaluation.

    - title : "Who is eligible to attend?"
      content : "Students who meet the pre-requisites described above are welcome to attend. The workshop is also open to postdocs, faculty, and professionals, but we are unfortunately not able to offer accommodation (except in the hostels). You are welcome to join us virtually, or in person if you are able to make your own arrangements for accommodation. For participants who are joining us onsite but do not need accommodation on campus, the local registration is sufficient."

In the very unlikely event that you register and accommodation on campus is unavailable, we will refund your registration fee."
