    - title : "What is the evaluation criteria for obtaining a certificate?"
      content : "For the certification, we expect consistent participation.

      content : "Students who meet the pre-requisites described above are welcome to attend.

You are welcome to join us virtually, or in person if you are able to make your own arrangements for accommodation. For participants who are joining us onsite but do not need accommodation on campus, the local registration is sufficient."
